# Work In Progress


* A negative balance is not possible

partially implemented, pending review not leaking domain logic and unit tests

* One credit card or debit card is linked with one account

Implemented relationship and code structure to support this, pending unit tests

* Account should contain at least some user details, card details and current balance

[WIP] Creating profiles to handle seeds and tests

* One rest endpoint to see current available balance in all accounts 

[DONE] Implemented endpoint and unit tests

* One rest endpoint to withdraw money
* One rest endpoint to transfer money

* It should be able to audit transfers or withdrawals


[IGNORED]

* Feel free to make some assumptions if needed & mention them in the code assignment
* Front end part is not required


### Nice to have:
* Good to have: Deploy this service somewhere (AWS/Azure) or deploy locally
